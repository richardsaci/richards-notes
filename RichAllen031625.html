            <li>Rich has been in bed for three to four weeks</li>

            <li>What are your thoughts about Aderall?</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Rich has been on Aderall before and he thinks that he needs to get back on it.</li>
                <li>Aderall - Ask Rich if he thinks aderall would help at the current dosage of Klon.</li>
                <li>He has been on it in the past and he thinks it might help he get out of bed and have a productive
                    day.
                </li>
                <li>What is the downside of trying Aderall for a month?</li>

                <li></li>
            </ol>
            <li>Lily going back to live with her mom at the end of the school year.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>He is going to take this hard?</li>
                <li>She is 14 and wants to live with her mom. He mom has resolved all of the issues that caused the
                    state to
                    remove Lily in the first place.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
            <li>I am really worried that one of these days Rich is going to say it is just not worth the fight.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>He has told me several times that the only reason he does not commit suside is that he is worred
                    about the afterlife.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Klonapin - if you give him some adderall, I think he needs to keep the Klonapin prescription and
                gradually
                reduce the amout he takes. We could ask him to keep a log of when and how much he takes.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>What does Klonapin do for Rich?</li>
                <li>What does Aderall do for Rich?</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Finally, I am starting to think I need an appointment with you. Rich calling me everyday to tell me how
                horrible his life is and not being able to do anything about it is taking a toll on my mental health.
            </li>



            <li>Walmart issue</li>
            <ol>
                <li>While I was recently out of town with my wife.</li>
                <li>I recently had to go stay in Charleston for five weeks with my wife for her to have radiation
                    treatments for skin cancer.</li>
                <li>During this time Rich was arrested at Walmart for stealing. He spent one night in jail and has a
                    court apprearance in April.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
            <li>Destroying our homelife.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>He is doing a lot of damage to our family.</li>
                <li>When Rich is having a bad day, which is most days, everyone around him gets forced into a bad day.
                <li>When Rich is having a bad day, it upsets our entire home life.</li>
                <li>He is misserable and he is bringing down our home.</li>
                <li>He gets in a horrible mood.</li>
                <li>My wife of 34 years has threatened to leave me over Rich. She is fighting two kinds of cancer and
                    the stress of our home makes everything worse.</li>

                <li>We are all walking on eggshells.</li>
                <li>Anytime someone says they are having a bad day on dont feel good. Rich has to comment like it is a
                    competiton. "No one has it as bad as he does."</li>
                <li>I cannot get on to Rich about getting arrested because I am always worried about suiside </li>
            </ol>


            <li>I am hoping to schedule some time with you for myself.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>I am hoping to schedule some time with you for myself. Can you have two patients from the same
                    family?</li>
                <li>Could we do telephone therpy?</li>
                <li>I have prayed many time for god to take me home. I really hate my current situation.</li>
                <li>Having to live with Rich, take care of my aging mom, and have custody of my 14 year old
                    granddaughter has triggered my depression.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
