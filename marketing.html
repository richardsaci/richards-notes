        <li>What are your goals. Scope Creep.</li>
        <li>Not enough time for Marketing and Sales.</li>
        <li>Frequently you are the most technical person in your company and because of that you end up spending all of
          your time doing the technical work. If only you had a team that you could delegate a project to and know that
          it was going to be taken care of and </li>
        <li>Why small MSPs fail.</li>
        <li>Marketing and Sales</li>
        <li>Team of five but they are all technical.</li>
        <li>No one is focused on sales.</li>
        <li>There is no way you can be successful if someone is not totally focused on sales.</li>
        <li>As a consultant you spend so much time learning and servicing customers.</li>
        <li>Why small MSPs must use outsourcing</li>
        <li>Coaching, Hybrid Consulting, Consulting, Training,</li>
        <li>Most consultants are in Tech because they love tech. Sometimes that is a problem. At the end of the month
          they find they have spent all of their time doing what they love and that is learning and consulting with
          customers.</li>
        <li>They either have to find a reliable person to handle sales, do the sales themselves, outsource sales.</li>
        <li>Remember it is very hard for someone to sell your vision of what your company offers.</li>
        <li>If you decide to become the CEO of your company and focus on Sales and Management, then you need a White
          Label Partner to be able to do the billable hour work.</li>
        <li>Belinda the CEO, President, Consultant, Trainer, so many hats are not possible.</li>
        <li>There are only so many hours in a year.</li>
        <li>Nothing happens until somebody sells something.</li>
        <li>With AI changing our business at a rate never seen before, you need a team to help you keep up.</li>
        <li>Savings are also a big part: Training cost, The annual Power BI Conference is 2K for registeration. So it
          would cost you over 3K to send an employee to this event.</li>
