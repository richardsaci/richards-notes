            <li class="title">Introduction and update.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>I am back home and I think we need to regroup. Our new business seems to have gone off of the rails.
                <li>What we are doing is not working and I think you are paying Ekta for nothing.</li>
                <li>I worry that with GP's future not very clear and Chris getting close to considering retirement, he
                    could sell his business to someone that whats the customer list just to migrate the customers to BC
                    or F&O. Three possible outcomes for you guys are...</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Protects you guys better than Belinda and I did.</li>
                    <li>Protects you guys the same as Belinda and I did.</li>
                    <li>Does not protect you guys at all and your work dissapears.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>I have invested seven months and you have invested even more.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="title">Review my two current projects.</li>
            </li>
            <li>I am finding it hard to write up the requirements since I do not possess the skills with Power BI that I
                had with GP. Also I am finding the customers are having a hard time telling me what they need. Maybe we
                need some
                robust questionnaires.</li>

            <li>I am having to pull every requirement out of the customer</li>

            <li>I have asked several times for the team to document things they learn so we can add the documents to our
                Knowledge
                Base. to date I don't think I have received anything yet.</li>

            <li>Wasn't the original the plan for Ekta to work 8:00 AM EST to 5:00 PM EST?</li>

            
            <li>Kim has indicated to me that business is slow at the present. She mentioned that more customers are doing more of there own implementation.</li>

            
            <li>The amount of online resources that customers can use today is considerable. Some of the
                checklists that are coming out of ChatGPT and other LLMs are amazing.</li>

                <li>Chetna left in early February</li>
                <li>Ekta hours do not align with training classes. One hour dinner at 10:30 AM and Leaves for the day at
                    2:00 PM</li>
                <li>If I had to do an analysis of the work she has done offline I would guess about ?? hours.</li>
                <li>She could not setup a screen sharing support meeting. Excel?</li>
