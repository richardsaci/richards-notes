            <li>03-26-2025 - Arrived at Municiple Court @ 9:55 AM - Talked with Lt Harrington with Manning Police. He was checking people into the Court. He marked Rich's name off of his printout. I told him about about applying for a Public Defender and not hearing back. He went in the back office and talked with Jason. Came back and said Rich did not have court and we should wait until a Public Defender contacted him.</li>
