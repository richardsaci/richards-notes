  <h3>Accounting for SACI and Fabric Warehouse</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Project Management</b></li>
    <ul><li>I think this syncs up with the Projects in Sharepoint Lists which are reported on via Power BI in the service at app.powerbi.com.</li></ul>
    <li><b>Becoming an expert on Business Central. </b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>When we first started talking about restarting SACI and becoming consultants for Business Central, Kuldeep and
        I discussed how Belinda became an expert in Dynamics GP. It was because she used it everyday doing our
        accounting which made her think like a user and know the features inside and out. We agreed that the role Ekta
        was hired for would do all of our accounting and thus become an expert.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Business Central</b></li>
    <ol>
      <li><b>General Ledger</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Financial Statements - Build the following financial statements in SACI and Fabric Warehouse.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Income Statement - Last Month and YTD Column</li>
          <li>Income Statement - Annual - 12 Months and Total</li>
          <li>Balance Sheet</li>
          <li>Cash Flow Statement</li>
          <li>Build these statements using the statement formats in BC Cronos Sample Company</li>
          <li>Monthly on or about the 15th I will hold a meeting with Kuldeep to review Financial and Management
            reports.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>


      <li><b>Accounts Receivable and Invoicing</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Did you guys bill Account Net and Jim Henson Company from BC or did you create invoices in another app?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>These invoices need to be added to BC if they were created outside of BC. Ekta and I invoiced Jim Henson
            previously out of BC. She knows how to invoice customers out of BC and invoice then via email directly from
            BC.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Capturing and Reporting Billable Hours</li>
        <ol>
          <li>By midnight each Sunday, all billable hours for the week need to be sent to Ekta.</li>
          <li>Weekly Ekta will gather all billable hours from consultants and enter them into the system via imports.
          </li>
          <li>Every two weeks Ekta will invoice customers for all billable time.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>

        <li>See Credit Card analysis below.</li>
        <li>Within the first 15 days of each month, Ekta will need to reconcile the bank accounts. See list below.</li>
        <ol>
          <li>First Citizens for Fabric Warehouse</li>
          <li>American Express for SACI</li>
